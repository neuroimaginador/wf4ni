# wf4ni

There are a lot of packages in the R ecosystem focused on several aspects of Neuroimage processing, many of them listed in the [CRAN Task View: Medical Imaging](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MedicalImaging) section: `oro.nifti`, `oro.dicom`, `RNifti`, `fmri`, `divest` (among others) for reading/writing of images; `ANTsR`, `fslr` for more advanced processing methods; `RNiftyReg` specialized in registration, `mritc` focused in image segmentation. Many more, for DTI, fMRI, molecular imaging, and visualization are available in [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

This package has been written and is developed with some key features in mind:

- Simple definition of Neuroimaging flows, which can incorporate both `R` functions (including those from other packages, such as `ANTsR` or `fslr`) and _Deep Learning_ models. 
- Simple definition of _Deep Learning_ models. Many wrappers to common models ([U-Net](http://google.com/?q=unet), [SegNet](http://google.com/?q=segnet) ...) have been included to ease the definition of models.
- Highly customizable models, allowing concatenation and merging of models, layers, branching...
- Creation of a common interface for all models built with this package, regarding training, testing and inference. This is achieved by the use of R6 classes.
- Tackle different types of problems: classification, labelling or regression.
- Work natively with NIfTI files.
- Native 3D, although vector representations of images are allowed (and, in some cases, adviced).
- Simple memory management. Users can impose memory constraints when training a model, batch size is automatically adjusted.
- Dataset repositories. Some datasets regarding typical Neuroimaging problems (brain extraction, segmentation, parcellation...) are released in public repositories, and a mechanism to get these datasets into our local system to be able to train models is also included in the package.

## Requirements

The goal of wf4ni is to ...

## Installation

Currently, this package is not in CRAN. The only way to get this package installed is by obtaining the source and building and installing the package in a local system.

```
#!bash
R CMD INSTALL /path/to/dl4ni
``` 


You can install the released version of wf4ni from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wf4ni")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
